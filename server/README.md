# Websockets client to synchronize volleyball scores.

This project was made in two days to be displayed on a youtube
[livestream](https://www.youtube.com/live/QMieiebMtug?feature=share&t=1095).

Server:

1. Authenticates the judge
2. Receives commands from judges
3. Sends data changes to clients

It displays the data in a clear and minimalist format.

## How to run

Run `npm run dev` in server directory.
