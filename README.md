# Volleyball score-keeping website

This two day project was used in a youtube [livestream](https://www.youtube.com/live/QMieiebMtug?feature=share&t=1095) to keep track of scores on different fields. It prevented overcrowding in the stands. And allowed students to check on their team during breaks.
